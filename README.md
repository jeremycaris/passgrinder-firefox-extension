Generate twenty-character strong passwords from your master password and the domain name or unique phrase you choose.

PassGrinder is a free password generator that is designed to make it easy for you to use strong, unique passwords that you don't have to save or remember (no internet connection required). Enter your master password and PassGrinder generates a twenty-character strong password based on the website URL, domain name, app name, or unique phrase you choose. Every time you enter that master password and phrase, PassGrinder will generate the same strong password. Your PassGrinder password is generated locally in your browser â€” it is never saved or transmitted online. Try it out, read more, or audit the open-source code at PassGrinder.com.
